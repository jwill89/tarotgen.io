# Auto-tag + GitHub Release when the current version has no release yet. Run by
# the CI "release" job on a push to the default branch, AFTER the gate jobs pass
# — so only green commits are ever released.
#
# The tag is v<version> (from frontend/package.json) and the release body is the
# matching "## [<version>]" section of CHANGELOG.md, so a green version bump
# auto-publishes a release linked to its notes. Idempotent: a version already
# released is skipped, so ordinary pushes are a no-op. When the git tag already
# exists (e.g. created by hand) but has no release, the release is attached to it;
# otherwise the tag is created at the pushed commit.
