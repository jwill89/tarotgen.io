/**
 * Which accounts the API may demote or delete. Two rules:
 *
 * - No admin removes their own admin flag or deletes their own account from the
 *   user-management page (DELETE /account is the way to leave). One wrong click
 *   there locked an admin out, and with the last admin gone only
 *   scripts/make_admin.php on the server could undo it.
 * - An account whose email is in PROTECTED_ADMIN_EMAILS (comma-separated, any
 *   case) can't be demoted or deleted through the API by anyone, itself
 *   included, so the site's owners stay admins whatever another admin account
 *   does. Its password can still be changed.
 *
 * The API has no way to deactivate an account, so there is nothing to refuse
 * there.
