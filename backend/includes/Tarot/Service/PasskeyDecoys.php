/**
 * Stand-in passkey credential ids, so that passkey sign-in options for an email
 * look the same whether or not it belongs to an account with passkeys (the
 * decoy approach of WebAuthn §14.6.2, "username enumeration").
 *
 * Why not simply drop allowCredentials: passkeys are registered with
 * residentKey "preferred", so an authenticator that can't store one (an older
 * security key) made a non-discoverable credential, and nothing recorded which.
 * Those only answer when the server names their id, so an email-scoped sign-in
 * has to keep naming them.
 *
 * The stand-ins are derived from the email with a secret key, so asking twice
 * gives the same ids, as a real account's would, and nobody without the key can
 * tell them from real ones. Their count and lengths vary the way real accounts'
 * do (mostly one passkey; ids of 16 to 64 bytes, by provider).
 *
 * The key is made on first use and kept beside the database (in production
 * outside the web root): no setting to configure. It isn't in the nightly
 * backup; losing it only changes every stand-in once.
