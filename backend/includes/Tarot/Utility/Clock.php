 * The one way PHP writes timestamps: UTC, in SQLite's own format.

 * Every timestamp column must agree with SQLite's CURRENT_TIMESTAMP and
 * datetime('now') (always UTC), and the frontend parses them all as UTC
 * (frontend/src/utils/datetime.ts). PHP's date() uses the host's zone instead,
 * which was only correct because production happens to run UTC (AUDIT §1.4).
 * Values compare as strings in SQL, so expiries must use the same zone as now().
